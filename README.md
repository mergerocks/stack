This repository contains a collection of stack examples from [Merge](https://merge.rocks).

## About Us

We are UX first SaaS and fintech agency. We specialize in assisting startups in building software, experimenting with new features, and bringing their product vision to life.

> In some of the examples in this repository, we utilize the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for mock data. This API allows developers to simulate RESTful API responses and is a great resource for testing and prototyping.

## Examples:

### React + Vite + Redux Toolkit

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tool</th>
    <th>Link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>React</td>
    <td><a href="https://react.dev/">https://react.dev/</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vite</td>
    <td><a href="https://vitejs.dev/">https://vitejs.dev/</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Redux Toolkit</td>
    <td><a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">https://redux-toolkit.js.org/</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This example demonstrates the implementation of a Todo App using the React framework, Vite as the build tool, and Redux Toolkit for state management. The Todo App showcases best practices for structuring a React application and utilizing Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
